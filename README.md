# Mad Pod Racing

## Questions

- Is the x and y the center of my pod?
  - yes
- does the center of our pod need to cross the edge of the checkpoint?
  - yes, the center of the pod needs to cross the edge of the checkpoint, which is 600 px from center
- is it faster to cut acceleration off and begin rotating before hitting checkpoint?

## Plan

### Lap One

- discover where the checkpoints are
- not fall too far behind

### The other laps

- figure out when to use boost
- use the boost
- turn early
