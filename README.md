# Mad Pod Racing

## Questions

- Is the x and y the center of my pod?
  - yes
- does the center of our pod need to cross the edge of the checkpoint?
  - yes, the center of the pod needs to cross the edge of the checkpoint, which is 600 px from center
- turning strategies
  - decelerate on the way into marker so we can make tighter turn
    - Problem, we might miss the marker
  - drift through the checkpoint
